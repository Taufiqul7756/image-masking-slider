# Image Masking Slider

Image Masking Slider is an interactive web component that allows users to compare two images (black-and-white and colored) by sliding a draggable line across the images. This feature is often used to highlight differences between two images or to reveal transformations.

## Features:

1. Draggable Slider: Users can drag a line horizontally to compare the two images side by side.
2. Button Controls: Left and right buttons provide additional control for moving the slider, improving accessibility and ease of use.
3. Responsive Design: The slider adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
4. Customizable: Easily change the images or adjust slider styles using Tailwind CSS.
